# 02-portfolio

## Description
This is the beginnings of my web development portfilio. I currently only have one live project that I can showcase. I do volunteer development work for Barks of Love Animal Rescue. I did not build their site from scratch, but I have helped them create and update content as well as redisign major parts of their website. I have worked on the site in a team and on my own. I do not have any other currently deployed projects so I have used placeholders.  The header contains a link to my Github profile that contains repositories from my college projects.
## Installation
N/A 
## Usage
The page has n nav bar that can be used to navigate the sections of the page. There are sections for a brief introduction of myself, links to my work, and contact methods. The email and LinkedIn links in the contact section are functional, while the Instagram and Facebook links are placeholders. As bootcamp progesses and I ake more reliably deployed applications I will add them to the portfolio. 
## Credits 
I obtained the background image from SVGBackgrounds.com. It is called "Endless Contsellation".
I used a W3Schools tutorial as reference for making the image title cards. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_title.asp
I sued the Space Mono font from google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono?query=space+mono
